## 2025-06-25 - Outlined Goals and Brainstormed (1 hrs)
I looked a lot at the commercially available options for camera sliders for design inspirations since I have not taken any cinematography class in a while and hence would not know much about filming. A lot of the time was brainstorming for this project. Spent writing down the goals that I had for this project, which were to have a light frame so that it can be attached to a tripod; a smooth rotation/movement which will be driven by stepper drivers; try out PCB designing by making a CNC shield for an ESP32 board; also, having the robot be controlled by a ps3 or ps4 controller with minimum setup required. I also started to think of the different brackets and configurations that I could do for the linear joint, rather a 2020 aluminum extrusion with linear rails, or aluminum bars with bearings. Based on the cost and weight, I choose with one linear guide rail with the frame being just one 2020 bar. The concern that I had was the frame being unstable or prone to tipping.
